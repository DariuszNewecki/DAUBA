# Vision — DAUBA, CORE, and the Bootstrapping Software Era

## Why Start “Dumb”?

DAUBA (“Dumb And Ugly But Ambitious”) begins with the most minimal, naive approach possible: a text box, a connection to an LLM, and the ability to write code.  
We choose to embrace the “dumb” beginning—**not as a flaw, but as a feature**.  
In biology, all complex systems start simple, then *evolve*.

**DAUBA is a living experiment in digital evolution.**

## Built for *Everyone* — Especially Non-Experts

**DAUBA is by design for “wannabe programmers” and explorers—not just professional developers.**

- If you know what you want, but not *how* to code it—DAUBA can help you get there.
- If you’re curious, ambitious, or just want to experiment with AI-powered coding—**this tool is for you**.
- The interface is deliberately simple and forgiving: all you need is an idea and a prompt.

**AI will get better at coding. DAUBA is here so you don’t have to wait to benefit.**

## Self-Evolution as the Core Principle

Traditional software is “done” when it meets a spec.  
**DAUBA (and later, CORE) is never done.**  
It is built to upgrade, mutate, and improve itself—first by user prompt, later by internal self-reflection and recursive code generation.

**We believe:**
- Any system that can *edit itself* will outpace any static, “perfect” app.
- The path to true “AI-native” software is not careful planning, but *evolution* and *self-awareness*.

## From DAUBA to CORE (The Last Programmer)

DAUBA is our scaffold—**the starter kit for a self-writing system**.  
Our endgame is **CORE**:  
- A meta-programmer that can understand its own gaps, reason about its design, and propose (or implement) its own upgrades.
- A tool that is “the last programmer you’ll ever need”—capable of recursively bootstrapping any codebase, including itself.

**DAUBA and CORE are not static projects—they are platforms for creating better programmers, better tools, and new forms of digital agency.**

## Forking, Mutation, and the Open Evolutionary Loop

Anyone can fork DAUBA or CORE.  
- Some forks may become smarter.  
- Others may focus on niche domains, or go in wild new directions.

**This is not a bug—it’s the feature.**  
The project is designed to be forked, mutated, and evolved by anyone.

The future we imagine is an *ecosystem* of AI-driven software tools, each one a living member of a family tree, not a locked-down product.

## The Invitation

We invite you to:
- Use DAUBA to solve your own problems—even if you’re a beginner.
- Fork it, break it, make it better, make it weirder.
- Help us build CORE—and push the limits of what “self-improving software” can mean.
- Remember: The best thing you ever build might be a platform that lets others build something greater.

**The future isn’t finished. It’s forkable. Let’s evolve it together.**
